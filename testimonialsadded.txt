We've had the privilege of adopting 3 lovely greyhounds from Greyhound Lifeline.
The rehoming team are knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and are always willing to give advice.
We were particularly impressed by the effort they put in to assessing the dogs' individual characters so you can adopt a dog that suits your own circumstances.
We wouldn't get a dog from anywhere else!

We went to visit Greyhound Lifeline to see if a greyhound might be the right dog for us one day - and fell in love with our boy, Vic, then and there.

The only trouble was that we didn't have anywhere to live. I will always be grateful to Greyhound Lifeline for patiently looking after him for us for about five months while our house purchase went through. In that time, we got to know them pretty well and saw first hand how well they care for their dogs. They also look after potential owners very well too and we felt supported both through and after the adoption process.

I would encourage anyone who is thinking of adopting a dog to consider a greyhound from Greyhound Lifeline: our two have settled very well into home life
and bring us an incredible amount of joy.

Greyhound Lifeline were brilliant at guiding us through choosing our dog, helping us to decide which dog would be ideal for us and supporting us throughout the process.

They really care about getting the right home for the right dog and are always only a phonecall away should there be any problems or help needed, no matter how long after adoption.

Our Experiences with Greyhound Lifeline – 
After having dogs for most our lives we decided to home a retired Greyhound and approached a local homing centre which was Greyhound Lifeline for these lovely Hounds!

– Our first contact was with Marie Harris who is the Kennel Manager.
On our first contact we were invited to visit the centre so we could see firsthand some of the Greyhounds which needed homes – 
Marie and her staff were very welcoming, and offered us plenty of insight in to what we could expect should we decide to home one of these Hounds and felt free to ask any questions. We were both pleasantly surprised to find a Kennels which were well kept and most importantly staff who had a wealth of knowledge about Greyhounds. 

On our first visit we found two hounds we particularly liked, unfortunately both were reserved. 
We were advised before we could undertake an adoption a home check would need to be carried out. Well from there on things moved quickly 
– The following week we received a call from Marie to say one of the Greyhounds was now unreserved and would we like to take up the option of homing {as we had already passed our homing check} we said yes we would come for a further visit to make sure – 
We arrived full of excitement and took another look at what was a lovely Fawn and Red Bitch named Polly – We didn’t stop to think, as we knew straightway this was a Hound we wanted to provide a “forever home” for and was cat friendly– We collected Polly the following day and Polly has proved to be all that we could have expected with homing such a lovely Hound.
One year on and we returned to home another Greyhound named JD who is a beautiful black dog – Marie had suggested we take JD {now called Jack} home for the day to see how he would fit in to our home environment and how he would get along with our other Greyhound Polly and our Cat – Jack never looked back and nor have we, and we now have two delightful and loving hounds which have now found there forever homes.
We can both definitely say that our experiences have been a good one. – We now have two amazing Greyhounds and know we always have the support and knowledge of Marie Harris and her team should we need to ask for any advice. 
Finally to anyone who reads this testimonial Greyhounds are highly addictive. Commonly once a Greyhound owner always a Greyhound owner and it’s very common for one Greyhound pet to suddenly become 2 as we did (or even 3 or more in some cases}

Choc came to live with us in March 2009. He came for a day’s trial, settled right down on the cushion in the lounge and never went back to the kennels!

We previously had a lurcher (mostly greyhound) and when we lost him, we missed having a big dog around, plus we liked his gentle nature.
We found out about Greyhound Lifeline on the web – they had a three-legged greyhound looking for a home and our lurcher had lost a back leg when he was a youngster, so we were well used to dealing with a special chap. 
That greyhound came for a home visit and proved a bit too interested in our old Yorkies – he was lovely but quite enthusiastic – and Marie suggested we might be better suited to Choc.  Choccie had hurt his back in a race and needed some TLC.
So here we are with Choc.  He is a lovely boy, very gentle natured – never been a problem around the Yorkies or our old Jack Russell. He’s pretty much always been subservient to the girls!  He loves fuss and his food, lying in the sun and generally chilling - and while he loves to run up the garden, it’s hard to imagine that such a couch potato could have ever been a racing greyhound!
Choc also now lives with a Lakeland terrier cross, who came with lots of baggage but he and Choc have bonded and are best pals.
We cannot speak highly enough of Greyhound Lifeline – not just for matching us to Choc, but also because we think they do a fabulous job caring for the greyhounds and finding them forever homes.  Whenever we meet anyone who shows the slightest interest in Choc, we enthuse about Greyhound Lifeline and the joys of “owning” a greyhound – not sure you ever own one!
As for Choc, he would tell you how contented he is, and how pleased he is that he landed on his paws with Greyhound Lifeline, but he’s fast asleep in his bed, at peace with the world.

We adopted our first greyhound, Maggie, from Greyhound Lifeline in Feb 2008. Despite having waited a long time to be homed, she settled into “home life” as if she’d never been anywhere else!

Having had more active breeds in the past, mainly Border Collies, it was amazing to discover how easy and undemanding greyhounds were. No surprise then that a couple of months later we adopted Ben after meeting him on the RGT walk at Southsea.

The latest addition to our family is Sleepy George who we met at the Greyhound Lifeline kennels Open Day this year. He is such a lovely boy and has settled into his new home with no problems whatsoever.

We would like to thank Marie and her dedicated team at Greyhound Lifeline for bringing these lovely dogs into our lives and for always being there for support, advice or just a friendly catch-up.
